Design is fantastic and chic, the satellites are absolutely tiny and a joy to look at, while the subwoofer unit matches nicely. I am not a Bose-head, as I have been underwhelmed by many Bose products in the past (like the Bose IE1 in-ear headphones and the Bose Companion IIs), but these produce stellar sound. To my ears, the sound is equalized perfectly for all genres of music from classical to jazz soft rock to Ke$ha. Details are crisp on the high end, bass is warm and rarely muddy, and the mid-range projects very well.Some fellow audiophiles of mine who have tried out these speakers have complained that the mid-range subdues the highs and makes for a lack of treble - I disagree completely. But as with all speakers, especially of this price range, I'd expect that you try them out in a store or at a friend's place before you buy.While these speakers are awesome, I have heard other speakers that come pretty close to the sound that these can produce for hundreds of dollars less. The Harmon Kardon Soundsticks Series II and III are some examples, along with the Klipsch ProMedia system. I find the balance of these Bose speakers just right, yet others come close. That said, unless you need something absolutely top-of-the-line and have been saving up your $300 for these speakers all along, I would hold off and buy something a big cheaper.Minor complaint - These speakers also come with Bose's fair share of wiring issues. The connection between the satellites and the subwoofer is VERY loose on the subwoofer unit; this has only been getting worse, and now I have to actually wiggle the cables and turn and twist and tilt them a couple of times just to get sound to come out of either satellite unit. If I just kick the subwoofer, underneath my desk, a TINY bit, it'll cause the wires to glitch up and the speakers will make awful popping noises as I adjust the cables all over again. I may be the only person experiencing this, yet having experienced similar things happen to Bose systems, I wouldn't doubt it if this came to annoy you in the end, too.Cheers, and hope this helped you make an informed decision!- EZ", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Phenomenal", "unixReviewTime": 1323561600, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2011"}

Unless I am not doing something right! when using live view the camera does not pre-focus before taking the picture - Instead when I aim the camera at my subject and press the shutter half way (which would be the way to focus normally) the camera does nothing, instead you have to press the shutter all the way down - then it focuses and also takes the picture in one feld swoop! Now this has been my experience so far at least with close subjects, say 12 feet or less, and when in the macro mode for example you have no idea if your image will be focused or not until AFTER the trigger has been pulled. If I am doing something wrong please let me know - but the way I read the manual this is the way it works. I personally like to know if my image is in focus first, before taking a picture. Of course if you do not use the live view function and use the viewfinder instead all is swell. so I am not very confident when using the live view mode, which is the only reason I did not rate this camera 5 stars. As far as additional lenses are concerned, after reading some of the other comments about not having cheaper lenses. I have purchased the 50 mm f2.0 macro and find it to be excellent, especially in the macro mode - clarity and sharpness is noticably better than the kit lenses, and I am not knocking the kit lenses by any means. But I have also crossed referenced pricing on some of the other lenses - and find minimal differences in pricing - for example I am very interested in the Olympus 11-22mm zoom and you can buy this for right at $600.00 - Nikon, Cannon, and Sigma all have almost the same price for appx. the same lens - and I find that to be the case on most of the other lenses when comparing apples to apples, with one exception and that would be the 1.4x converter - the olympus is definitly higher than any of the other brands. someone had mentioned prime lenses in an earlier comment and olympus does make the 35mm and Sigma makes a 24mm for olympus which should be perfect for a good prime considering that would double to 48mm on this camera.

Lots of pretty colors and designs but cheap build quality and hollow sound. Not so with the J2's. These may not look like much, very plain, but the sound is full and even plus I have found them to be comfortable. Some say the highs are too bright but I haven't had that problem, in fact it has a certain richness I found lacking in other sets.

While I really wasnt wanting to spend that much it was the best thing for me, This new 50mm is rock solid and even at f1.4 I get consistently focused pics! I traded the d3200 up for the d5200, and with this new 50mm f1.4 on here, all i can say is WOW! - What a huge improvement. Now I have total confidence at anytime, to just go out and regardless of the shooting mode am getting great looking, in focus pics. It may have just been the lens i got had something wrong with it, or just the fact the 35mm had such a narrow depth of field, I am not sure, But what I do know is now I have complete confidence with the 50mm f1.4, where as I had none at all with this 35mm. My advice to anyone would be  by all means make your purchase on amazon and check this lens out for yourself, if you are getting out of focus pictures you have 30 days to send it back and get a different lens.. For me even at higher aperature settings this lens was just not nearly as sharp as the 50mm I replaced it with.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Impossible Focus", "unixReviewTime": 1360540800, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2013"}

Well here is what I have found to be, in my opinion, practically useless. As long as you are using the kit zoom that comes with this camera focusing is a nightmare. with the kit zoom the lens will focus and lock-in relatively quick, within a second or less. but no matter which one of my full size lenses I use it takes this camera from 4 or 5 full seconds to focus and lock-in! that is just ridiculously long. and on top of that you will be lucky if the camera has actually focused accurately, so it is impossible to have any confidence at all in whether your going to get a good picture or not when using any lens other than the ones specifically made for this camera! In addition this camera does not allow you to have any control over the ISO, the default is ISO 200, however when you are taking pictures and are in automatic the camera will set all three of the following, shutter speed, F-stop - and the ISO. you never know what the camera is going to choose! So when I wanted to use my 70-300 zoom with an f-5.6 - I needed to make sure the ISO was relatively high to keep the shutter speed up, but even in bright sunlight this camera simply refused to allow the focus to take any less than 5 seconds - then more often than not it would not let me take a picture because it was saying there was not enough light even in very bright sunlight! UNBELIEVABLE. Now if I could manually set the ISO to a highr range this should solve this problem but you cannot manually set the ISO! Now it may be the battery is not really big enough to allow my regular lenses to focus and operate properly, maybe, I dont know but there is no way I can use any of my lenses with any confidence at all that I will even get a picture let alone the fact that even when I do it must be a non-living or non-moving item because it takes soooooooo long to focus. In addition I took this to the beach the other day and even with the kit lens, thier was a guy sitting on the beach and he had been feeding the seagulls, so he must have had at least 300 birds at his feet. well at one point they all began to fly off, so I quick took a shot, then waited and waited and waited till the camera finally finished writing the picture to the card ( while your waiting the screen freezes and you just have to wait to take a second picture) by the time the camera finally let me take a second shot, all the 300 of the birds were gone baby gone! again RIDICULOUS! I give this camera 3 stars only because when you finally do get a picture taken the image quality is great. all my shots were taken with middle setting for quality - so I could go down in quality 2 notches or up in quality 2 notches with the best being in raw ( god only knows how long it would take this camera to write a raw image to the card, you could probably call your girlfriend while you wait! the screen is totally un-useable in any normal outside daylight - you cant see what the heck you are trying to focus on. - I will get rid of this pretty quick and just go ahead and buy the E620 at least I know that will work right the way it is suppose to, this camera does not. if you are hell bent on buying this anyway, you go girl! But make sure you only use the lens's that are actually made for this camera and dont believe for a second if you allready own any Olympus Lens's that the regular lenses are going to work for you - good luck and good night! - Ken Of Gulf Shores", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "What You Really Need To Know", "unixReviewTime": 1285718400, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2010"}

As others have mentioned these are a bit bass heavy and lean more toward rap,club, dance, etc. But that doesn't mean other forms of music won't sound good. I think some people expected them to sound good right out the box but these don't work like that. At first I too was dispponted with the bass heavy sound, but after reading the enclosed V-MODA card under the \"trueHERTZ\" title saying that these are \"optimized to have the EQ and sound enhacements turned off\", I did just that. I flaten out the EQ and turned off the audio effects and sure enough they sound better. Better to the point that these can be enjoyable. For anything other than rap or club I turned the treble up a little and they did a good job with those other types of music as well. I'm not saying that these are great beyond great or anything like that, I've heard better, but the Crossfade's aren't nearly as bad as some would have you believe. Again, these are a bit unbalanced, but not to the point where you couldn't enjoy anything else other than bass heavy music.Next thing to do is a good burn-in to see if that will make a difference. A burn-in process did help my JLab earbuds (yes, I do think burn-in helps a little) so we'll see if it helps here too.Update 8/18/12 More observations.The more I use the Crossfade's the more I like them. The burn-in did help a little because the sound is a touched more balanced and warmer. Of couse it could be all in my mind but that's an issue for another day LOL. It's still a bit bass heavy, but a quick, lite attunement to the EQ is all that's needed. These are VERY sensitive to adjustments to the EQ. In fact I keep the EQ close to flat most of the time, no effects at all. That's the best way to listen to these. It's almost like V-MODA tried to keep as close to the true studio prodution as possible.I love the Kevlar-reinforced cables. Because they're so light and string-like it makes them very nonintrusive, plus they seem to be tangle resistant.The sound ports on the sides of the headphones really do a good job of noise isolation while playing music. While listening to some music I noticed that I had my TV on. I thought I had turned the sound down on the TV, but it was playing at it's normal volume. Just to test how good the isolation was I turned down the music through the V-MODA'S and upped the volume on the TV. All I heard mostly was the music, even when it was at a low volume. Now, if you aren't playing anything you will hear some outside noise, but while playing something outside noises are kept out nicely. Good job V-MODA.I've worn the Crossfade's for hours in comfort. The only adjustment I had to make was bending the \"flexsteel\" headband so ear cups weren't too tight over my ears. The extra soft foam ear cushions are comfortable.If I do run into problems I will update my review, but as it stands I have to give these an extra half star.

I have owned and used high-end buds from Klipsch, Sennheiser, Shure, Denon, and Monster, but they shared a common problem: the in-canal design, no matter what, gets very uncomfortable and painful after extended use. And they all blocked noise almost completely, which made no sense to use in more casual, quieter settings and social situations. With many of them, the bass was deep and muddy, the highs were piercing, and midrange was just lacking, leading to hollowness in sound. I needed the earbuds that would address all of these issues, and I finally found them: the IE2s.I tried the Bose IE1 earbuds and they just didn't cut it. The bass was more noticeable than with other non-in-canal earbuds but the quality was just mediocre. The silicone tips also came off way too easily, making them very easy to lose, even just from stuffing the buds in your jean pocket. They didn't live up to the Bose name.The IE2s address all of those problems. The sound quality is stellar and the most balanced I have heard from earbuds. Bass is punchy and tight, highs are crisp and delicate, and wow. There's actually some midrange to the sound. As a result the sound from these buds is always rich and warm, never hollow or tinny. Vocals are really brought out, and the details really come out in the background. And those details are amazing; when playing a piano track, \"The Portrait\" from Titanic, I could hear the pianist's foot pushing down on Tyne pedal, something I had never before noticed. Especially in songs involving an orchestral score, you will hear details and embellishments you had never before noticed, especially if you're upgrading from standard iPod-style earbuds.The fit is snug, and the StayHear tips are much more comfortable than they look. They're REALLY soft and they don't feel much different than having white iPod buds in your ears. There are three silicone tips of varying sizes in both StayHear and standard designs, so that makes six total. None of them, however, will isolate sound for you. They are also generally pretty loud, but you can definitely hear what people around you are saying in the living room regardless of that.So if you need buds that sound great, feel light and comfy in your ears, and you don't need sound isolation, the IE2s will surely do it for you.

I would have to say I save about 5 to 8 bucks a month, but cutting off a standart  strip is a bit ackward. I know it sounds like I'm being lazy, but sometimes I don't want to walk all the way over the strip when I'm tired and want to go to bed, or in a rush to leave the house, so for me a \"smart\" strip is the way to go.With the ZuniDigital strip I have my TV plugged to the main outlet, so when I cut it off; the other stuff I have plugged into the strip shuts off as well. The main device will be in \"stand-by\" mode so it will never be completely off, but the other stuff will be powered down completely. Nice! One device in stand-by to four completely off is a good trade. I also like the fact that it has two \"consistant\" outlets because I use the internet when I don't watch TV. I only want my router and modem on; so why cut everything else on just to use my computer? They don't use a lot of power like a cable box or TV anyway so that's another good trade off.Now, I know it won't save as much money as when you cut off the entire strip, but I don't mind the extra buck or two a month to save a little time and effort.The strip isn't bad or geeky looking either. It looks like a standart power strip, but dare I say, a bit sleeker. It makes my 2 year old Monster power strip, that I paid $35 for, look toyish.

I listen to stations using the Tune-In radio app for my Droid Bionic because I can listen to radio from across the country, not just in my area. The sound on my phone alone is ok for talk radio and news stations, but of course it's not too good for music.First off, the build quality is good and feels pretty solid. It comes with a short USB to mini USB cable and also has an audio cable for the AUX input. Pushing buttons gives off a solid \"click\" and they don't feel like they will come off any time soon. The varied amount of inputs is a huge plus for such a small item. The \"Boombox\" is only about 3 inches wide and about 2 inches thick on each side so it's ideal for small, tight areas and the speakers on each side are quite big for such a small device. The display is small but fairly clear and pretty informative. The electronic setup of the device even allows for a firmware update. I visited the Visual Land web site to see if one existed, but couldn't find any. Still, it's good to know it can be updated because while the physical idea behind this speaker system is very good, there is a certain weirdness that comes out when trying to use the controls:When using the AUX input the sound using the phone isn't loud, but will get louder if I push the play/stop button twice. The first push will cut the signal off; the second push will make the signal come on again, but louder?If I push and hold the \"menu\" button nothing happens, but if I push and hold the \"forward\" button the menu screen decides to pop up. In fact, the \"menu\" button doesn't work at all when the AUX input is being used.It has an EQ, but it can only be accessed when a USB or SD card is inserted?The clock only shows in military time? Or maybe I can't find a way to show standard time, but it shouldn't be so hidden.I tried the radio but wasn't able to get any stations. That's not totally the fault of the item though. The area I work in is very bad signal wise to begin with. But still, I should get a hint of a signal. The device doesn't catch anything.Well, none of the weirdness prevents it from it's main purpose, producing sound, so I can't fault it too much, but it shouldn't be this bad out the box. As far as the sound is concerned the only source I've used so far is the AUX, so when I get a chance I will update this review when I use an SD card or USB. As it stands now, using the AUX, it's ok at best. I tried to make adjustments from my cell (since I can't seem to do it from the unit itself) but that really didn't help too much. However, I really didn't expect it to pound out heavy bass or fill a room, and sure enough, it didn't. In fact, I would say it's just a step up from a cell phone. Voices sound fine in the lower range but kinda hollow in the higher ranges, plus they are projected way too out in front of the music which in itself, can distort when it's turn up. Mid range, sadly, is very tinny at times and it doesn't produce bass at all from some songs. Keep in mind, however, I'm using the AUX source from a cell phone so digital media, like from a USB, should sound better. How much better I'll find out later.For now, three stars is all I can give this item because it seems like a case of form over function. I've seen this item being sold for $65 dollars in other places but I wouldn't pay any more than $25.Update 2/24/12I found some more weirdness but also some goodness. First the weird. Pluging in an AUX cable while it charging via USB seems to override the On/Off swich. Not a big deal either but still a lack of quality control. However, as promised, I did get chance to use a SD Card with music on it. Just as expected the sound quality was a little better. Clearer, sharper highs. More defined and richer mids. Bass was a little better too. Still overall, with it having two speakers, I expected a little better.Now I can say it's a soild three stars instead of a weak three. Still I wouldn't pay over $25 for it. It does the job so the rest of the flaws I can overlook, but thinking about the device itself, this could've been a really good product if it had better electronic quality control and better sound.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Decent but weird", "unixReviewTime": 1328832000, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2012"}

I don't worry about devices falling off too much, but that's mostly because the tray doesn't tilt up very much.

That means that the tray only holds one device at a time.-The tab that holds tablets for charging does not provide a secure hold.  My station resides on an end table next to the couch; I don't have to worry about the tablet falling and hitting the floor because the couch provides a 'wall'.

I also have a MacBook Pro and an iPad mini, but I still find this to be a great companion device that I actually use regularly. That said, I also have a Surface Type Cover, which I find to be an essential part of the experience.Pros:- Great battery life - runs a full day, about 10 hours, not a problem.- Build quality and aesthetics second only to the iPad line of tablets- Comes with Microsoft Office FREE- Built-in stand is handier than you may think, as is the type/touch coverCons:- You've heard this one: the Windows Store is a big lacking on the apps- Tablet is just a tad heavy; heavy enough that you'll want to use it as an touchscreen laptop more than a tablet- Kickstand is non-adjustable- Cameras aren't the best- Windows RT obviously can't run x86 appsThings I almost always do with my Surface RT as a college student:- Watch movies- Take REAL notes in class with images, formulas, etc. I use Word, Evernote, and OneNote.- Compose e-mail on the go- Write papers and do assignments- Skype conference- Take it to work in a crowded workspaceThe problem:Windows RT is what deceives people most, in my opinion. Microsoft includes a desktop in Windows RT that resembles that of Windows 8 x86, which sets the consumer up for disappointment when he/she realizes that Intel and AMD-based apps cannot run on the Surface RT. Microsoft never made it entirely clear that the Surface RT was not a full-featured Windows tablet that could run Steam, Photoshop Elements, or Matlab.If you know what you are getting into, however, and you know that Windows RT is sufficient for you, then I recommend this tablet highly.For me, the Windows Store has been more than enough to satisfy my needs. Honestly, a device that has built-in, full Office that has a hardware-connected keyboard (no finicky Bluetooth keyboards!) and a very long battery life is a perfect companion device for many college students.Disclaimer: I got my Surface RT used, and for a stealer price at $325, which included a Type Cover, a Snugg leather case, and a 64GB MicroSDXC card.BUY THIS THING USED and WITH A KEYBOARD INCLUDED!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Highly underrated", "unixReviewTime": 1378857600, "reviewTime": "09 11, 2013"}

After just using it for a few weeks, one of the keys ripped right out of the socket and it is nearly impossible to re-attach it. As of now, I am still using just the leather case, and am happy with it.2. The iPad mini has thin side bezels, so showing all of the screen is essential. This case covers up the edges of the screen ever so slightly that it gets hard to hit some of the on-screen buttons at the bottom of the iPad, like the multitask bar or app controls. The iPad also doesn't fit quite as snugly in the case as I'd like it to - it slides down, covering up even more of the bottom edge of the screen.3. The flap for keeping the case closed is very awkward, and it can be a hassle trying to fit it into the loop on the opposite end. It does stay quite secure, though.4. The stand works great when it is out, however it is hard to put the stand away. Often times this will require two hands, one hand to push the support up and another to fold the stand in.5. Doesn't appear to protect the corners and edges of the iPad as much as it seems to. Drop your iPad on its corner, there's still enough &#34;wiggle room&#34; between the iPad and the case that you may still injure your iPad.Pros:1. The keyboard holds in place with a magnet. Brilliant. Don't need a keyboard? Just pop it off, and you have a slimmer iPad case.2. The stand is awesome. The case also folds back on itself, so if you don't have a keyboard you need to use, just fold the stand on top of the back of the case and you have something like a Smart Cover.3. Keyboard seems to pair more successfully/quickly than other keyboards. Key latency is also lower with this keyboard than other keyboards I've used, namely ones from Logitech and Minisuit.4. The keyboard has palm space. This is awesome.5. The case has an awesome feel to it, almost like real leather.6.

Then got the d5200 and was quite surprised how much different that camera was compared to the 3200, I almost kept the d5200, but there was a couple things I was not happy with but could have lived with. So I returned the d5200, and preordered the d7100, had about a month wait, but well worth it. This camera is bigger than either one of the other two, which fits my hands much better, the ownerers manual is 3/4 of an inch thick compared to maybe an 1/8 inch thick on the d5200. The best thing I like is this model has two thumb wheels, one on the back of the camera right above where your thumb will naturally go, and one just below the shutter button where your index finger will naturally be, so you can use the back one to adjust shutter, and the front to set aperature, this makes it extremely easy to use in manual mode, so easy in fact I almost always shoot this way,. With the 5200 you only had one wheel on the back, so to adjust shutter you had to use the same wheel for adjusting aperature plus push another button to switch from aperature adjust to shutter adjust, all three cameras are completely different in many respects in my opinion, not just added features, the d7100 other than processing power really is a completely different camera, I love it, very Happy. I use this camera both commercially as well as just plain fun. I am so glad I opted to upgrade from the d5200, but if your a woman or fairly new to dslr's, you may find the d5200 a better fit for your hand and its lighter, These issues were not a concern for me and this camera fits my hand much better, and is definitly a more professional camera in every respect, their is a very good reason the owners manual is so thick!

This makes the marked-up prices on Amazon look a lot more innocent. I strongly recommend you get the 16GB version, because the 8GB version leaves you with just over 5GB of usable storage.I've used MANY other 7\" tablets on the market. I've used tablets as cheap as Coby tabletsCoby Kyros 7-Inch Android 4.0 4 GB 16:9 Capacitive Multi-Touchscreen Widescreen Internet Tablet with Built-In Camera, Black MID7042-4and Idolian tabletsIdolian TURBOTAB C8 (TM)- 7 inch, 1.5GHZ CPU, 5 Point Capacitive Touch Screen Tablet PC-Android 4.0, 512MB DDR3, 4GB with Google Market. I've used tablets from bigger names, including the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 PlusSamsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus 16GB (Dual Core, Universal Remote, WiFi)and the Acer Iconia A100Acer Iconia TAB A100-07U08U 7-Inch Tablet (8GB). Of course I have also used the competing red-hot Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet.The Nexus 7 fits right in-between these budget tablets and high-end tablets in terms of price, but in terms of performance, it soars above all of them. As of August 2012, this is the best 7-inch tablet on the market of all of the ones I've used. It's way faster than any of the aforementioned tablets, it's more aesthetically pleasing, it has the best display of all of them, and it has by far the best internal specs. The first of its kind to be running Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean, an OS that prioritizes user input to yield smoother animations, transitions, scrolling, and an overall \"buttery\" interface, it also comes with a very capable quad-core processor. You can really feel that the tablet is just quicker than most Android tablets out there, even in doing something as simple as pinching to zoom. It's very hard to go back to one of the older tablets once you've experienced the buttery feeling of Jelly Bean on the Nexus 7. As a point of reference to iOS users out there like me, this is, in my opinion, the first 7-inch tablet to feel as responsive as an iPad, something few tablets rival when it comes to user interface performance. No more hitching and juddering when switching home screens or scrolling through apps, no more laggy zooming and scrolling.The device is very comfortable for me to hold in one hand, and I enjoy reading books on it more than I do on my iPad 3, even with its Retina display. The text is still incredibly crisp on the Nexus 7, even though it's not quite Retina quality, and the white color of the pages is very neutral and easy on the eyes. It doesn't skimp on the beautiful page-turning animations, either! The weight is identical to a paperback book of similar dimensions, and the back makes for a good grip. It also, unlike so many other tablets, shows no fingerprints on the back. The Gorilla glass on the front of the device has not scratched even remotely, even with keys and coins in my cargo pocket. The tablet feels rugged, yet not overly heavy.The one thing I miss from other tablets when using this one is the microSD expansion slots that so many Android tablets have. MicroSD was my preferred method of side-loading content and applications onto my devices because it saved me a USB port. However, this isn't a huge issue, as the Android file manager for Windows and Mac is actually very user-friendly and straight-forward to use. 16GB is enough for me (actual available storage is about 13.4 GB), as I use Google Play Music in the cloud for the vast majority of my listening, stream movies from my laptop using doubleTwist, and mostly read ebooks and surf the web. However, these are only my needs, and they worked out for me. If you are a media content packrat who needs to have all of their media on the go, this tablet is DEFINITELY not for you. If you can consolidate and bring only the stuff you know you need, this is perfect.Do note that this device has no rear-facing camera, and that the front-facing camera cannot take still shots.Google Now is fantastic. I hope this comes to more devices soon, because I would argue that it outdoes Siri in many, many ways.Battery life is a comfortable 8 hours doing a lot of different tasks with WiFi enabled and near-maximum brightness.My only complaint about the device is that when using headphones, a very, very faint buzzing can sometimes be heard when manipulating the screen. Turning off screen sounds in settings made it better, but sometimes it comes back.For the price, you can't go wrong with this tablet. This is, while affordable, in no means a budget tablet like the Coby Kyros or IdolPads. Those tablets have lower-quality displays, bulky designs, and often don't support many applications. Some of them have stretched, distorted pixels, and others aren't as responsive to touch. With the Nexus 7, you don't have to worry about any of that. The out-of-box experience is comparable to that of an Apple product, in which the darn thing \"just works\". Kudos, Google. You've made something, for the price, that makes Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Apple all watch their backs.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best tablet for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1344038400, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2012"}
